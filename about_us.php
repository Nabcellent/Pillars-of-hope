        <h1 class="text-center font-weight-bold">OUR HISTORY</h1>
        <div class="border-top border-dark w-75 mx-auto my-5 my-sm-3"></div>
        <p>This is a non profitable institution which was started in 2013 with two
            gentlemen namely Sir Vitalis Nyambeka and Sir Moses Muchika. Sir Vitalis
            used to live and work at Nairobi with his family. He supported the home
            financially whereas Sir Moses used to live in the home with the kids. Sir Vitalis
            would visit them in the weekend. Their vision was to restore hope to the
            hopeless. It was located at Kajiado county, Kitengela, opposite Noonkopir
            Muslim Girls.
        </p>
        <p>By then it had 36 kids whereby Sir Vitalis had 30 children and Sir Moses 6
            Children. It had eight rented rooms. At first it had 8 rooms which were rented.
        </p>
        <p>By the end of 2014 it had55 kids and more rented rooms were added. The kids
            together with the Directors faced many challenges like lack of water, enough
            food and also a learning institutions s were too far. In 2016 the home got a
            certificate that the home was registered under the registrar of societies. By
            then it had 81 kids and 47 rented rooms which was to be paid 47,000/=
            monthly. Food started being inadequate therefore the directors decided that
            they go and ask some food from the market (kitengela). They were given and
            also allowed them to go for more food if they needed.
        </p>
        <p>In 2017 the owner of the land (landlord) wanted back his land after the
            directors found out that he had been distributing the home bank tins at the
            malls, supermarket and receiving money without their acknowledgement
            therefore the children were taken to other homes while others to their
            guardians (those who had) and others had no choice but to go back to the
            streets.
        </p>
        <p>In 2018 Sir Vitalis Nyambeka revived the home after one of the well-wishers
            donated a land. (33by 55). It was located at Machakos County Athi-river near
            Daystar University behind the China Company site.
        </p>
        <p>Before it was temporarily constructed, the dorms were rented for both boys and
            girls. It was then constructed, and they shifted. The Ndovu cement came for a
            visit and after hearing the history agreed to construct for them. The director
            told the owner of the land about it but surprisingly she said that she had
            changed her mind and would sell it at 4 million. The Ndovu cement company
            went underground never to contact them. Life there was hard because of many
            challenges, one was that they had to walk for long distance in order to get
            water to bathe, wash, and clean which wasn’t enough.
        </p>
        <p>The director had to do manual work like carrying heavy stones on a
            construction sites to sustain the children’s daily needs.
        </p>
        <p>Food was a problem for they depended on well-wishers for support. If we never
            got visitors, we stayed without food. In one of the construction sites, the
            director met this lady who agreed to give them water for free. She also gave a
            piece of land where they would do farming. After not receiving the first
            installment, the owner of the land wanted it back. The lady who provided water
            for them told them to move to the farming land. It was half an acre and she
            was selling it at 4 million.
        </p>
        <p>This land was near the water point, the school and also the main road.
            Through social media the director met a Nigerian man who wanted to fully
            support the home. He agreed to pay for the land and construct for them. A
            meeting was conducted to discuss the payment of the land. At the meeting the
            owner increased the price to form 4 million to 7.5million. After the meeting, the
            well-wisher lost interest in the home and disappeared without a call.
        </p>
        <p>Due to its high price, the director decided to look for another land. Through
            prayers, a land was found. An acre that goes for 4million near Daystar
            University. The first fundraising was conducted online whereby the first
            installment of 100,000 shillings was raised.
        </p>
        <p>The owner of that land donated 500,000 shillings. The remaining amount to
            pay is 3.4 million. The second fundraising will be held on April 2021. We pray
            and hope that everything goes well and the kids finally get a place to call home.
